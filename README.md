# `Project LookingFor </Dev>`
### `The Project`
The ideia about this project it's just study and forfun! The LookingFor </Dev> it's like a Tinder, you find a developer in your region and you can talk about development and you can share informations. 

### `How to use?`
You have to make a little register with some informations for example.
![git_register](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32501381/81082901-44618080-8eca-11ea-83d3-b9769a931926.png).
After this you have to make a login with yours credentials.

### `Tools used`
For this application I used:
- [X] ReactJs for WebView
- [X] Node Js for backend
- [X] Styled Component/Css
- [X] Geolocation
- [X] Axios
- [X] React Hooks

Obs: Not yet deployed. Still I'm development application on Mobile.
